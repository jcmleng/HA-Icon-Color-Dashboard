# HA-Icon-Color-Dashboard
Home Assistant Icon Color Dashboard
This is the full yaml for a dedicated Home Assistant Dashboard which has 1 button for 1 available color code in Home Assistant based on https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/dev/homeassistant/util/color.py
This is to enable easy picking of an icon color rather than work off the description in the link.
