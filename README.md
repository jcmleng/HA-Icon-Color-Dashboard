# HA-Icon-Color-Dashboard
Home Assistant Icon Color Dashboard

This is the full yaml for a dedicated Home Assistant Dashboard which has 1 button for 1 available color code in Home Assistant based on https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/dev/homeassistant/util/color.py

This is to enable easy visual selection  of an icon color rather than work off the description in the link. The buttons themselves do nothing but the colour code can be copied from the button config.

23 June 24: Revised the dashboard to sort by colour shades instead. Higher Resolution file of this new dashboard has been added
